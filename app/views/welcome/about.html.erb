<h2>What you need to know about the Festival Swimmers Club.</h2>

<p>The club is open to all Association members in good standing and are able to swim 100 yards
  (4 lengths of the pool). The primary focus of the club is to provide structured group swimming workouts for those
  wanting to improve their fitness through swimming and / or want to join in competition.
  Work outs are designed under the guidance of United States Master Swimming (USMS) certified coaches.</p>

<p>Residents who cannot swim or cannot swim sufficiently to participate in the structured swim workouts will be
  recommended to obtain more swimming instruction and try again.
  Basic swimming instruction will be obtained outside of the scope of the club and will be the responsibility of the resident
  to eventually be able to swim the 100 yards in order to participate in the clubâ€™s structured workouts.<p>

<p>All members are required to submit a Club Membership application and pay dues and sign a liability waiver.
This waiver allows USMS coaches to provide you with individual instruction for 30 days as part of your club dues of the structured swim workout.
After that time members who would like to continue to receive coaching must join the USMS Association.
All club members may participate in the structured swim workouts regardless of affiliation in the USMS.</p>
